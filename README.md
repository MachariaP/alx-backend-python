## 🗄️ Database Design Overview

<details>
<summary><b>👉 Click to expand database design patterns</b></summary>

<br/>

### 🗄️ Key Entities

While this project is primarily focused on Python programming concepts rather than database operations, the codebase demonstrates data structure patterns that would typically map to database entities in a production system:

- **GithubOrg**: Represents GitHub organization data fetched from APIs (would map to an Organization table)
- **Repository**: Contains repository metadata including name, license information, and configuration (repos_payload fixtures)
- **TestPayload**: Structured test data mimicking API responses, demonstrating proper data modeling
- **NestedMap**: Hierarchical key-value structures representing complex data relationships

### 🔗 Relationships

In the context of the GitHub client implementation:

- **One GithubOrg has many Repositories**: A GitHub organization contains multiple repositories, demonstrating one-to-many relationships
- **One Repository has one License**: Each repository is associated with a license configuration (one-to-one relationship)
- **Data Nesting Pattern**: The `access_nested_map` utility demonstrates traversing hierarchical data structures, similar to navigating related database entities through foreign keys

**Note**: This is an educational project focused on Python concepts. In a production backend system, these entities would be stored in databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB with proper ORM (SQLAlchemy/Django ORM) or ODM patterns, foreign key constraints, and indexed relationships.

## 🔒 API Security Overview

<details>
<summary><b>👉 Click to expand security measures</b></summary>

<br/>

### 🔒 Security Measures

| Security Measure | Implementation & Importance |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **🛡️ Type Safety** | Type annotations and mypy validation prevent type confusion attacks and ensure data integrity by catching type mismatches at development time before they reach production |
| **✅ Input Validation** | All functions validate input parameters against expected types, ranges, and formats. Prevents injection attacks, buffer overflows, and malformed data from propagating through the system |
| **🔐 Secure API Communication** | Uses HTTPS for all external API calls (GitHub API integration). The requests library validates SSL certificates by default, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks |
| **🎭 Mocking External Services** | Test suite mocks all external HTTP calls and API dependencies, preventing accidental calls to production systems during testing and avoiding exposure of credentials |
| **📊 Error Handling** | Comprehensive exception handling for KeyError, ValueError, TypeError, and HTTP errors prevents information leakage through error messages and ensures graceful degradation |
| **🔄 Rate Limiting Awareness** | Code design considers API rate limits (GitHub API has request limits). Production implementations should include exponential backoff, request throttling, and quota monitoring |
| **🔑 Secrets Management** | No hardcoded credentials or API keys in codebase. Environment variables and configuration files (excluded from version control) should be used for sensitive data |
| **🧪 Security Testing** | Unit tests verify proper handling of edge cases, malicious inputs, and error conditions. Integration tests ensure secure end-to-end data flow without leaking sensitive information |
| **📝 Code Review Process** | All code changes require review to catch security vulnerabilities, ensure adherence to security best practices, and validate proper implementation of security controls |

### 🎯 Why Security Matters

Even in educational projects, implementing security best practices from the start builds muscle memory for production systems. Type safety prevents entire classes of bugs, proper error handling prevents information disclosure, and secure API communication patterns translate directly to real-world applications. These security foundations are critical for building trustworthy backend systems that handle user data and integrate with external services.
